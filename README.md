The purpose of the drone is to provide a simple and understandable code that is needed to build an Arduino based auto-level quadcopter flight controller.
The code is well commented and clearly explained in the YMFC video tutorials. This makes it possible to further develop the YMFC-AL flight controller code for your own purpose.
If you encounter any problems during the build or setup please check the Q&A page first. Most questions are already answered in detail.
